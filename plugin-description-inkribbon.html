<h2>🖋️ InkRibbon — IntelliJ Plugin</h2>
<blockquote>
    <em>"A lone typewriter sits quietly in the corner.<br>
        Its ink ribbon is intact."</em><br>
    — <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>Amid the chaos of code, between unknown bugs and builds that fail without reason, there is a safe place.<br>
    <strong>InkRibbon</strong> is your typewriter. Your only method of salvation.</p>
<p>This plugin for IntelliJ IDEA is inspired by the legendary save system from <em>Resident Evil 2</em>.<br>
    Instead of saving your survival, it lets you save your <strong>developer progress</strong>.</p>
